# Overview

The Blockchain Voting System is a decentralized application (dApp) that utilizes blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting processes. This system leverages the Ethereum blockchain to create an immutable record of votes, offering a reliable and trustworthy solution for digital elections.

# Features


1. Decentralized Voting: Utilizes blockchain to securely record and protect votes from tampering.

2. Candidate Management: Supports the addition and management of multiple candidates.

3.Vote Casting: Ensures each voter can cast only one vote, preventing double voting.

4. Real-Time Results: Provides up-to-date results, displaying vote counts for each candidate.

# Technologies
1. Smart Contracts: Developed using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

2.Backend: Implemented with Truffle for smart contract development and testing.

3.Frontend: Built with React and interacts with Ethereum smart contracts via Web3.js.

4. Testing: Includes comprehensive unit tests for verifying smart contract functionality.
# Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.Clone the Repository: Obtain a copy of the code by cloning the repository to your local machine.

2. Install Dependencies: Set up the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

3.Configure Ethereum Client: Start an Ethereum client like Ganache for local development.

4.Deploy Smart Contracts: Compile and deploy the smart contracts to the local blockchain.

5.Run the Application: Launch the frontend application to interact with the deployed contracts.
